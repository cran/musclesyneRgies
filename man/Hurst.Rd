\title{Hurst exponent}
\usage{
Hurst(P, min_win = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A time series (numeric)}

\item{min_win}{Minimum window length in points}
}
\value{
A list with elements:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{loglog} containing the log-log plot from which the HFD is calculated\cr
\item \code{Hurst} containing the Higuchi's fractal dimension of the time series.
}
}
\description{
Hurst exponent
}
\details{
\code{Hurst} calculates the Hurst exponent based on the R/S approach as in Hurst (1951).
For motor primitives, the minimum window length should be bigger than the period
(i.e., the length of each cycle), as reported in Santuz, Akay (2020).

\description{
Hurst exponent
}
\details{
\code{Hurst} calculates the Hurst exponent based on the R/S approach as in Hurst (1951).
The Hurst exponent is a measure of global complexity and it increases if the “accuracy” of
the time series decreases across several cycles (thus the term “global”).
The Hurst exponent can vary between 0 and 1. For 0.5 < Hurst exponent < 1, in the long-term high
values in the time series (the motor primitive in our case) will be probably followed by other high
values and a positive or negative trend is visible (Mandelbrot, 1983; Gneiting & Schlather, 2004).
For 0 < Hurst exponent < 0.5, in the long term high values in the series will be probably followed
by low values, with a frequent switch between high and low values
(Mandelbrot, 1983; Gneiting & Schlather, 2004). Hurst exponent = 0.5 corresponds to a completely
random series (Mandelbrot, 1983; Qian & Rasheed, 2004). In other words, values of Hurst
exponent approaching 0.5 from both ends indicate more complex (or random) behaviour of the
time series (Hurst, 1951).
For motor primitives, the minimum window length should be bigger than the period
(i.e. the length of each cycle), as reported in Santuz, Akay (2020).

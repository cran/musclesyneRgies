\title{Import RData or ASCII data into R}
\usage{
rawdata(path_cycles = NA, path_emg = NA, header_cycles, header_emg = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_cycles}{Optional, path where cycle timing files are located}

\item{path_emg}{Optional, path where raw EMG files are located}

\item{header_cycles}{Logical, are the cycle files containing a named header (the header is optional)?}

\item{header_emg}{Logical, are the raw EMG files containing a named header (they should)?}
}
\value{
List of objects of class \code{EMG}, each with elements:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{cycles} data frame containing cycle timings, with as many columns as many cycle subdivisions are wanted\cr
\item \code{emg} data frame containing raw EMG data in columns, first column must be time in the same units as in the cycle timings
}
}
\description{
Import RData or ASCII data into R
}
\details{
Supported are R lists saved as RData files or tab- or comma-separated files
readable through \code{read.table()} or \code{read.csv()}.
The first column of each raw emg file must be time in the same units as those used for the
cycle timings (e.g., [s] or [ms]).
If reading from RData files, please call cycles \code{CYCLE_TIMES.RData} and raw EMG \code{RAW_EMG.RData}. Lists
must be saved with \code{save()}.

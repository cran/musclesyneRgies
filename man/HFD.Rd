\usage{
HFD(P, k_max = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A time series (numeric)}

\item{k_max}{Maximum window length in points}
}
\value{
A list with elements:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{loglog} containing the log-log plot from which the HFD is calculated\cr
\item \code{Higuchi} containing the Higuchi's fractal dimension of the time series.

\description{
Higuchi's fractal dimension
}
\details{
The Higuchi’s fractal dimension is a measure of local complexity and it increases together
with the “roughness” of the time series at a single cycle level (thus the term “local”).
Higuchi’s fractal dimension values range from 1 to 2, with increasing values correlating to
increasingly complex data and Higuchi’s fractal dimension = 1.5 indicating random
Gaussian noise (Higuchi, 1988; Anmuth et al., 1994; Kesić & Spasić, 2016)
For motor primitives, only the most linear part of the log-log plot should be used,
as reported in Santuz, Akay (2020).

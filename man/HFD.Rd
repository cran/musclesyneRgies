\title{Higuchi's fractal dimension}
\usage{
HFD(P, k_max = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A time series (numeric)}

\item{k_max}{Maximum window length in points}
}
\value{
A list with elements:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{loglog} containing the log-log plot from which the HFD is calculated\cr
\item \code{Higuchi} containing the Higuchi's fractal dimension of the time series.
}
}
\description{
Higuchi's fractal dimension
}
\details{
For motor primitives, only the most linear part of the log-log plot should be used,
as reported in Santuz, Akay (2020).
